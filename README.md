"# regex-crossword-py" 
“Simple GUI‑IZED (Gooey‑Eyes) RegEx Crossword Puzzle” is a Python/Tkinter app that turns regex practice into a game. Players fill a 5 × 5 grid (Scalable to fit randomized RegEx given) with 0s and 1s so each row and column satisfies its own regular‑expression clue, receiving real‑time error messages if any entry breaks a pattern or isn’t binary. A menu bar adds shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl + Enter to reveal the solution) alongside undo/redo placeholders, while buttons let users check work, reset, or show the answer. All validation logic lives in a testable validate_grid helper, making the GUI responsive and the core engine unit‑test friendly. The result is a compact, self‑contained learning tool that blends puzzle fun with hands‑on regex reinforcement—all in fewer than 300 lines of clear, commented code.
